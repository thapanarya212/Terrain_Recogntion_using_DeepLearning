Terrain Recognition using Deep Learning

Designed and implemented a deep learning model to classify terrain types such as rocky, sandy, grassy, and paved surfaces.

Collected and preprocessed image datasets, applying normalization, augmentation, and resizing for robust training.

Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) optimized for high accuracy.

Integrated OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction tasks.

Conducted hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, optimizer) to improve performance.

Achieved significant accuracy across diverse datasets by fine-tuning model layers and applying dropout for regularization.

Used Pandas and NumPy for data handling, analysis, and model evaluation.

Deployed the model on Google Colab for GPU-accelerated training and testing.

Documented findings, performance metrics, and confusion matrix analysis to validate results.

Published source code, dataset preprocessing steps, and training scripts for reproducibility.
